# TODO

- [x] Bootstrap the command-line app
- [x] Implement API Checksum Generation
- [x] Implement `checksum` command
- [x] Implement API Comparison Logic
- [x] Implement `compare` command
- [x] Detect changes to method parameters
- [x] Add tests for parameter changes
- [x] Handle top-level functions and variables
- [x] Add tests for top-level declaration changes
- [x] Detect changes to fields
- [x] Add tests for field changes
- [x] Handle enums
- [x] Add tests for enum changes
- [x] Analyze class and mixin hierarchies
- [x] Add tests for class hierarchy changes
- [x] Analyze generic type parameters
- [x] Add tests for generic type parameter changes
- [x] Detect changes to `const` variable values
- [x] Detect adding `abstract` keyword to classes
- [x] Perform deep analysis of supertype hierarchies
  - Implemented with helper methods for analyzing subtype relationships and improving return type compatibility checks.
- [x] Add support for Mixins and Extensions
- [x] Analyze constructors
- [x] Detect changes to member scope (static)
- [x] (Minor) Detect API deprecations
- [x] (Minor) Handle getters and setters explicitly
- [x] (Minor) Loosen generic type constraints
  - Fully implemented. Removing a bound is MINOR and changing to a less restrictive bound (supertype) is also MINOR.
- [x] Fix ScenarioRunner to detect multiple changes in an example file
  - Updated to scan for all MAJOR and MINOR changes in code comments and verify results more thoroughly
- [ ] (Minor) Allow return types to change to a subtype
  - Requires deep type analysis to check for subtype relationships. Currently, any change is treated as MAJOR.
